# ReBuilder
A Reinforcement learning model that can generate virtual cities with given requirements. It also comes with a builtin python based simple city visualizing tool.

### Applications
ReBuilder can be used for a variety of applications, including:

***Video games***: ReBuilder can be used to create virtual cities for video games. This could be used to create detailed cityscapes for open-world games, or to create custom cities for strategy games.

***Architectural simulations***: ReBuilder can be used to simulate the design and construction of cities. This could be used to test the feasibility of new urban planning schemes, or to assess the impact of climate change on cities.
